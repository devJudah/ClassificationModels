#Logistic Regression Classifier - Gradient Descent

##Project Overview
This repository contains a simple implementation of a logistic regression classifier built from scratch, trained using the gradient descent optimization algorithm. The goal of this project is to demonstrate how logistic regression can be implemented without using any external machine learning libraries, focusing on understanding the underlying mathematical principles behind classification and model optimization.
